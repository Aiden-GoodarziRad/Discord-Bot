Well Hello there!

My name is Aiden GoodarziRad, I'm 12 years old. I'm a programmer with experience for a little over a year. I'm currently a web developer but you may know me as the person who created the Discord Bot: Gamers Bot.

This repository is supposed to be for the Discord bot as a help center for it. You can find all commands for the bot, source code, & helpful contributors/how it started. Thank you for checking this GitHub Page and having the bot in your server or knowing about it. It means a lot to me.
